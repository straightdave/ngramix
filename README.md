Customized N-gram parser plugin of MySQL for mixed use of ideographic and alphabetic languages

## the main purpose
MySQL provides a built-in full-text parser for ideographic languages: Ngram, which is simply good enough for fulltext search.
While using its index to search English/English words embedded phrases, it goes the same way to seperate whole word letter by letter and this is not what we want.   

So, I need another simple alternative that could parser both Chinese and English words/characters properly.
This will be (yes, future tense) a simple plugin to MySQL, same as original 'Ngram' plugin.   

Hopefully it would come out in March, 2016.

## the basic ideas
